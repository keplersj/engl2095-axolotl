## [ENGL 2095](https://literaturebythenumbers.wordpress.com/) - Interactive Response

### Artist's Statement

In my paper on Julio Cortázar's "Axolotl" I discuss the shifting narrator of the
text. By relying on the inherently interactive nature of modern webapps and
making use of natural language processing technologies we're able to see
visually which narrator is speaking for each passage of the text. By opening the
link above and using your arrow keys to navigate passage by passage we can read
"Axolotl" in its entirety while your browser attempts to determine if man (shown
with a blue background) or animal (shown with a pink background) speaking.

While many of the passages in "Axolotl" are easy to determine the narrator, many
present a dilemma where even NLP algorithms have difficulty determining the
narrator. To demostrate this difficulty the webpage uses a gradient between the
man and animal colors to indicate the narrator. This allows clear passages to be
drawn with either a pink or blue color, while unclear passages get drawn with a
color inbetween the two.
