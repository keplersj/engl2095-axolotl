Sometimes it's called a \"filter\",\n// but that's not a great name for it, since that implies a thing where\n// some bits pass through, and others are simply ignored.  (That would\n// be a valid example of a transform, of course.)\n//\n// While the output is causally related to the input, it's not a\n// necessarily symmetric or synchronous transformation.  For example,\n// a zlib stream might take multiple plain-text writes(), and then\n// emit a single compressed chunk some time in the future.\n//\n// Here's how this works:\n//\n// The Transform stream has all the aspects of the readable and writable\n// stream classes.  When you write(chunk), that calls _write(chunk,cb)\n// internally, and returns false if there's a lot of pending writes\n// buffered up.  When you call read(), that calls _read(n) until\n// there's enough pending readable data buffered up.\n//\n// In a transform stream, the written data is placed in a buffer.  When\n// _read(n) is called, it transforms the queued up data, calling the\n// buffered _write cb's as it consumes chunks.  If consuming a single\n// written chunk would result in multiple output chunks, then the first\n// outputted bit calls the readcb, and subsequent chunks just go into\n// the read buffer, and will cause it to emit 'readable' if necessary.\n//\n// This way, back-pressure is actually determined by the reading side,\n// since _read has to be called to start processing a new chunk.  However,\n// a pathological inflate type of transform can cause excessive buffering\n// here.  For example, imagine a stream where every byte of input is\n// interpreted as an integer from 0-255, and then results in that many\n// bytes of output.  Writing the 4 bytes {ff,ff,ff,ff} would result in\n// 1kb of data being output.  In this case, you could write a very small\n// amount of input, and end up with a very large amount of output.  In\n// such a pathological inflating mechanism, there'd be no way to tell\n// the system to stop doing the transform.  A single 4MB write could\n// cause the system to run out of memory.\n//\n// However, even in such a pathological case, only a single written chunk\n// would be consumed, and then the rest would wait (un-transformed) until\n// the results of the previous transformed chunk were consumed.\n\n'use strict';\n\nmodule.exports = Transform;\n\nvar Duplex = require('./_stream_duplex');\n\n/*<replacement>*/\nvar util = require('core-util-is');\nutil.inherits = require('inherits');\n/*</replacement>*/\n\nutil.inherits(Transform, Duplex);\n\nfunction TransformState(stream) {\n  this.afterTransform = function (er, data) {\n    return afterTransform(stream, er, data);\n  };\n\n  this.needTransform = false;\n  this.transforming = false;\n  this.writecb = null;\n  this.writechunk = null;\n  this.writeencoding = null;\n}\n\nfunction afterTransform(stream, er, data) {\n  var ts = stream._transformState;\n  ts.transforming = false;\n\n  var cb = ts.writecb;\n\n  if (!cb) {\n    return stream.emit('error', new Error('write callback called multiple times'));\n  }\n\n  ts.writechunk = null;\n  ts.writecb = null;\n\n  if (data !== null && data !== undefined) stream.push(data);\n\n  cb(er);\n\n  var rs = stream._readableState;\n  rs.reading = false;\n  if (rs.needReadable || rs.length < rs.highWaterMark) {\n    stream._read(rs.highWaterMark);\n  }\n}\n\nfunction Transform(options) {\n  if (!(this instanceof Transform)) return new Transform(options);\n\n  Duplex.call(this, options);\n\n  this._transformState = new TransformState(this);\n\n  var stream = this;\n\n  // start out asking for a readable event once data is transformed.\n  this._readableState.needReadable = true;\n\n  // we have implemented the _read method, and done the other things\n  // that Readable wants before the first _read call, so unset the\n  // sync guard flag.\n  this._readableState.sync = false;\n\n  if (options) {\n    if (typeof options.transform === 'function') this._transform = options.transform;\n\n    if (typeof options.flush === 'function') this._flush = options.flush;\n  }\n\n  // When the writable side finishes, then flush out anything remaining.\n  this.once('prefinish', function () {\n    if (typeof this._flush === 'function') this._flush(function (er, data) {\n      done(stream, er, data);\n    });else done(stream);\n  });\n}\n\nTransform.prototype.push = function (chunk, encoding) {\n  this._transformState.needTransform = false;\n  return Duplex.prototype.push.call(this, chunk, encoding);\n};\n\n// This is the part where you do stuff!\n// override this function in implementation classes.\n// 'chunk' is an input chunk.\n//\n// Call `push(newChunk)` to pass along transformed output\n// to the readable side.

in front a delicate crevice barely slit the lifeless stone.\n  On both sides of the head where the ears should have been, there grew three tiny sprigs, red as coral, a vegetal outgrowth, the gills, I suppose.\n  And they were the only thing quick about it; every ten or fifteen seconds the sprigs pricked up stiffly and again subsided.\n  Once in a while a foot would barely move, I saw the diminutive toes poise mildly on the moss.\n  It’s that we don’t enjoy moving a lot, and the tank is so cramped—we barely move in any direction and we’re hitting one of the others with our tail or our head—difficulties arise, fights, tiredness.\n  The time feels like it’s less if we stay quietly.\n\n  It was their quietness that made me lean toward them fascinated the first time I saw the axolotls.\n  Obscurely I seemed to understand their secret will, to abolish space and time with an indifferent immobility.\n  I knew better later; the gill contraction, the tentative reckoning of the delicate feet on the stones, the abrupt swimming (some of them swim with a simple undulation of the body) proved to me that they were capable of escaping that mineral lethargy in which they spent whole hours.\n  Above all else, their eyes obsessed me.\n  In the standing tanks on either side of them, different fishes showed me the simple stupidity of their handsome eyes so similar to our own.\n  The eyes of the axolotls spoke to me of the presence of a different life, of another way of seeing.\n  Glueing my face to the glass (the guard would cough fussily once in a while), I tried to see better those diminutive golden points, that entrance to the infinitely slow and remote world of these rosy creatures.\n  It was useless to tap with one finger on the glass directly in front of their faces; they never gave the least reaction.\n  The golden eyes continued burning with their soft, terrible light; they continued looking at me from an unfathomable depth which made me dizzy.\n\n  And nevertheless they were close.\n  I knew it before this, before being an axolotl.\n  I learned it the day I came near them for the first time.\n  The anthropomorphic features of a monkey reveal the reverse of what most people believe, the distance that is traveled from them to us.\n  The absolute lack of similarity between axolotls and human beings proved to me that my recognition was valid, that I was not propping myself up with easy analogies.\n  Only the little hands … But an eft, the common newt, has such hands also, and we are not at all alike.\n  I think it was the axolotls’ heads, that triangular pink shape with the tiny eyes of gold.\n  That looked and knew.\n  That laid the claim.\n  They were not animals.\n\n  It would seem easy, almost obvious, to fall into mythology.\n  I began seeing in the axolotls a metamorphosis which did not succeed in revoking a mysterious humanity.\n  I imagined them aware, slaves of their bodies, condemned infinitely to the silence of the abyss, to a hopeless meditation.\n  Their blind gaze, the diminutive gold disc without expression and nonetheless terribly shining, went through me like a message:\n  “Save us, save us.”\n  I caught myself mumbling words of advice, conveying childish hopes.\n  They continued to look at me, immobile; from time to time the rosy branches of the gills stiffened.\n  In that instant I felt a muted pain; perhaps they were seeing me, attracting my strength to penetrate into the impenetrable thing of their lives.\n  They were not human beings, but I had found in no animal such a profound relation with myself.\n  The axolotls were like witnesses of something, and at times like horrible judges.\n  I felt ignoble in front of them; there was such a terrifying purity in those transparent eyes.\n  They were larvas, but larva means disguise and also phantom.\n  Behind those Aztec faces, without expression but of an implacable cruelty, what semblance was awaiting its hour?\n\n  I was afraid of them.\n  I think that had it not been for feeling the proximity of other visitors and the guard, I would not have been bold enough to remain alone with them.\n  “You eat them alive with your eyes, hey,” the guard said, laughing; he likely thought I was a little cracked.\n  What he didn’t notice was that it was they devouring me slowly with their eyes, in a cannibalism of gold.\n  At any distance from the aquarium, I had only to think of them, it was as though I were being affected from a distance.\n  It got to the point that I was going every day, and at night I thought of them immobile in the darkness, slowly putting a hand out which immediately encountered another.\n  Perhaps their eyes could see in the dead of night, and for them the day continued indefinitely.\n  The eyes of axolotls have no lids.\n\n  I know now that there was nothing strange, that that had to occur.\n  Leaning over in front of the tank each morning, the recognition was greater.\n  They were suffering, every fiber of my body reached toward that stifled pain, that stiff torment at the bottom of the tank.\n  They were lying in wait for something, a remote dominion destroyed, an age of liberty when the world had been that of the axolotls.\n  Not possible that such a terrible expression which was attaining the overthrow of that forced blankness on their stone faces should carry any message other than one of pain, proof of that eternal sentence, of that liquid hell they were undergoing.\n  Hopelessly, I wanted to prove to myself that my own sensibility was projecting a nonexistent consciousness upon the axolotls.\n  They and I knew.\n  So there was nothing strange in what happened.\n  My face was pressed against the glass of the aquarium, my eyes were attempting once more to penetrate the mystery of those eyes of gold without iris, without pupil.\n  I saw from very close up the face of an axolotl immobile next to the glass.\n  No transition and no surprise, I saw my face against the glass, I saw it on the outside of the tank, I saw it on the other side of the glass. Then my face drew back and I understood.\n\n  Only one thing was strange: to go on thinking as usual, to know.\n  To realize that was, for the first moment, like the horror of a man buried alive awaking to his fate.\n  Outside, my face came close to the glass again, I saw my mouth, the lips compressed with the effort of understanding the axolotls.\n  I was an axolotl and now I knew instantly that no understanding was possible.\n  He was outside the aquarium, his thinking was a thinking outside the tank.\n  Recognizlng him, being him himself, I was an axolotl and in my world.\n  The horror began—I learned in the same moment —of believing myself prisoner in the body of an axolotl, metamorphosed into him with my human mind intact, buried alive in an axolotl, condemned to move lucidly among unconscious creatures.\n  But that stopped when a foot just grazed my face, when I moved just a little to one side and saw an axolotl next to me who was looking at me, and understood that he knew also, no communication possible, but very clearly.\n  Or I was also in him, or all of us were thinking humanlike, incapable of expression, limited to the golden splendor of our eyes looking at the face of the man pressed against the aquarium.\n\n  He returned many times, but he comes less often now.\n  Weeks pass without his showing up.\n  I saw him yesterday, he looked at me for a long time and left briskly.\n  It seemed to me that he was not so much interested in us any more, that he was coming out of habit.\n  Since the only thing I do is think, I could think about him a lot.\n  It occurs to me that at the beginning we continued to communicate, that he felt more than ever one with the mystery which was claiming him.\n  But the bridges were broken between him and me, because what was his obsession is now an axolotl, alien to his human life.\n  I think that at the beginning I was capable of returning to him in a certain way—ah, only in a certain way—and of keeping awake his desire to know us better.\n  I am an axolotl for good now, and if I think like a man it’s only because every axolotl thinks like a man inside his rosy stone semblance.\n  I believe that all this succeeded in communicating something to him in those first days, when I was still he.\n  And in this final solitude to which he no longer comes, I console myself by thinking that perhaps he is going to write a story about us, that, believing he’s making up a story, he’s going to write all this about axolotls.\n  `;\n\n\n\n// WEBPACK FOOTER //\n// ./src/components/axolotl.ts","import * as React from \"react\";\nimport {\n  Appear,\n  BlockQuote,\n  Cite,\n  Code,\n  CodePane,\n  Deck,\n  Fill,\n  Fit,\n  Heading,\n  Image,\n  Layout,\n  List,\n  ListItem,\n  Quote,\n  Slide,\n  Text\n} from \"spectacle\";\nimport createTheme from \"spectacle/lib/themes/default\";\nimport { colorFromText } from \"../util/classifier\";\nimport axolotl from \"./axolotl\";\n\nconst theme = createTheme(\n  {\n    primary: \"#e3dce8\"\n  },\n  {\n    primary: \"Helvetica\",\n    secondary: {\n      googleFont: true,\n      name: \"Droid Serif\",\n      styles: [\"400\", \"700i\"]\n    }\n  }\n);\n\nexport default () => (\n  <Deck progress=\"bar\" theme={theme}>\n    <Slide>\n      <Text>{\"Cortazar's Axolotl\"}</Text>\n    </Slide>\n    {axolotl\n      .split(\"\\n\")\n      .map(passage => passage.trim())\n      .filter(passage => passage !== \"\")\n      .map((passage, index) => (\n        <Slide key={index} bgColor={colorFromText(passage)}>\n          <Text>{passage}</Text>\n        </Slide>\n      ))}\n  </Deck>\n);\n\n\n\n// WEBPACK FOOTER //\n// ./src/components/slides.tsx","import * as React from \"react\";\nimport AsyncSlides from \"../components/async_slides\";\n\nexport default () => <AsyncSlides />;\n\n\n\n// WEBPACK FOOTER //\n// ./src/pages/index.tsx","import { BayesClassifier } from \"natural\";\n\ntype rgbArray = [number, number, number];\n\nconst animalBase: rgbArray = [255, 192, 203];\nconst manBase: rgbArray = [173, 216, 230];\n\nfunction pickHex(color1: rgbArray, color2: rgbArray, weight: number) {\n  const w1 = weight;\n  const w2 = 1 -

It also includes refinements that are independent of\n * ethnic considerations.\n *\n * The rules for converting surnames into D-M Code numbers are listed below.\n * They are followed by the coding chart.\n *\n * 1. Names are coded to six digits, each digit representing a sound listed in\n * the coding chart (below).\n *\n * 2. When a name lacks enough coded sounds for six digits, use zeros to fill to\n * six digits. GOLDEN which has only four coded sounds [G-L-D-N] is coded as\n * 583600.\n *\n * 3. The letters A, E, I, O, U, J, and Y are always coded at the beginning of a\n * name as in Alpert 087930. In any other situation, they are ignored except\n * when two of them form a pair and the pair comes before a vowel, as in Breuer\n * 791900 but not Freud.\n *\n * 4. The letter H is coded at the beginning of a name, as in Haber 579000, or\n * preceding a vowel, as in Manheim 665600, otherwise it is not coded.\n *\n * 5. When adjacent sounds can combine to form a larger sound, they are given\n * the code number of the larger sound.  Mintz which is not coded MIN-T-Z but\n * MIN-TZ 664000.\n *\n * 6. When adjacent letters have the same code number, they are coded as one\n * sound, as in TOPF, which is not coded TO-P-F 377000 but TO-PF 370000.\n * Exceptions to this rule are the letter combinations MN and NM, whose letters\n * are coded separately, as in Kleinman, which is coded 586660 not 586600.\n *\n * 7. When a surname consists or more than one word, it is coded as if one word,\n * such as Ben Aron which is treated as Benaron.\n *\n * 8. Several letter and letter combinations pose the problem that they may\n * sound in one of two ways.  The letter and letter combinations CH, CK, C, J,\n * and RS are assigned two possible code numbers.\n *\n * For more info, see http://www.jewishgen.org/InfoFiles/soundex.html\n */\n\n/**\n * D-M transformation table in the form of finite-state machine.\n * Every element of the table having member with zero index represents\n * legal FSM state;
